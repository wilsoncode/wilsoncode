### :space_invader: Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Wilson. I have over 8 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startup and large company with offices across multiple regions. While Iâ€™m a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, service integrations and async mechanism).

:rocket:

I love building things (even involve myself in building a house for _orang asli_ - aborigines people). As for software development Iâ€™m most attracted to building software products from the ground up, solving real customer problems with business justification. I __seek to understand before making well-reasoned design decisions and tradeoffs__ for solutions.

:rocket:

Iâ€™m always interested in becoming a better technology leader and meeting interesting people across different fields of work.
